# odin-recipes

It's a first html project in Odin course after I learned some basics. In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website wonâ€™t look very pretty by the time I'll finished.

But I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

DESIGN
Backround: grey or other dark color. Or even some picture with flour or so.

Top banner: position: fixed, nice color, the name "Odin Recipe" in nice stylish font. 

Bottom baner: position: static (probably). 

Racipe-card.
    STRUCTURE:
    Each recepi looks like a card.
    listed in vertical block.
    picture floating to text.
    <!--in future add hover efect -->

    CONTENT:
    Image
    Title
    Description
    TIME: prep time, cooking time, total time.
    Link to recepi page
