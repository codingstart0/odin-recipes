# odin-recipes

It's a first html project in Odin course after I learned some basics. In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website wonâ€™t look very pretty by the time I'll finished.

But I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
